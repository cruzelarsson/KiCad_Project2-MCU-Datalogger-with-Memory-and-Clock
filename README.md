MCU Datalogger with memory and clock 

•	Designed and implemented a multi layer PCB microcontroller datalogger using ATMEGA328P-AU, integrated with a DS1337 and 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator to ensure precise timestamping with two 24LC1025 EEPROM chips for non-volatile data storage capacity.

•	Revamped the schematic with 2-layer PCD design while incorporating power regulation with zero DRC errors, proving the understanding of embedded systems. 

•	Optimized clock/reset circuits for a stable and reliable performance and provided easy debugging/reprogramming access. 

•	Produced a compact design with status LEDs, mounting holes and modular connectors, ensuring physical durability and visible feedback.

This project — MCU Datalogger with Memory and Clock — was supported by PCBWay through their PCB prototyping sponsorship program.

PCBWay provided high-quality manufactured boards that arrived perfectly aligned and finished. The fabrication quality was excellent, with sharp silkscreen printing, clean solder masks, and precise drill accuracy. Assembly and testing went smoothly, and the boards performed exactly as designed.

A huge thanks to PCBWay for their support in helping bring this project to life. Their fast turnaround and reliable service made the prototyping process straightforward and efficient.

Below you will find the printed out board; the missing components will be added and uploaded soon. Thank you!
